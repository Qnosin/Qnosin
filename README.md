Hi, I’m @Qnosin but to be precise my name is Jakub Putaj, i'm currently 18 years old
🧑🏻‍💻 I’m mostly interested and pasionate about computer science and when i have my free time I spent it among the lines of codes. When I'm not coding I usually play some computer games with my friends or take a break from everything to go for a walk 👟
🌱 I’m currently learning Front-end developer road, right now I know the foundation of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Now I'm working with React to help me reach my Virtual Dom (in Polish dom means House) when I will become great developer in the future
